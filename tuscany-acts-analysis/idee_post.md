# Hack Your Public Data

This post is the starting of a series of posts that will show you *How to hack Public Data* using Data Science and Machine Learning. 
The goal is to write a series of post that'll show how you can use public data to create data application. We are not going to focus on syntethizing state of art solutions while more on show you how to use the wealth of public data.


The first post series will focus on the `administrative acts` published by [Regione Toscana](http://www.regione.toscana.it/regione/leggi-atti-e-normative/atti-regionali). In particular, we are going to show:
- how to classify `acts` per the field `Ufficio Direzione Generale`
- how to extract the main topics from the published documents.

The main motivation of the first task is to show how good we can identify offices by their administrative acts, while for the second we are more interesting in understands the topics of the documents published by Tuscany Region Offices.
