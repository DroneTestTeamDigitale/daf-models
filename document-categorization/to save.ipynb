    "To figure out how big a model you’ll need, you must develop a model that overfits.\n",
    "This is fairly easy:\n",
    "- Add layers.\n",
    "- Make the layers bigger.\n",
    "- Train for more epochs.\n",
    "- Try different hyperparameters (such as the number of units per layer or the learning rate of the optimizer) to find the optimal configuration.\n",
    "- Optionally, iterate on feature engineering: add new features, or remove features that don’t seem to be informative.\n",

    "### Regularizing your model and tuning your hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some things you should try:\n",
    "- Add dropout.\n",
    "- Try different architectures: add or remove layers.\n",
    "- Add L1 and/or L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",

    "These are the most common ways to prevent overfitting in neural networks:\n",
    "- Get more training data.\n",
